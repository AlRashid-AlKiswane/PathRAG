"""
Checkpoint Callback Utility for PathRAG

Provides a reusable progress callback function that can be passed
into graph-building or long-running processes. This allows logging
and monitoring of progress without tightly coupling to the main loop.

Features:
- Logs percentage progress
- Handles invalid input safely
- Uses centralized logging via setup_logging

    Progress callback for graph building or batch processing.

    Args:
        processed (int): Number of items already processed.
        total (int): Total number of items to process.

    Returns:
        Optional[float]: Progress as a percentage (0.0â€“100.0) if valid,
        otherwise None.

    Notes:
        - Logs progress at the INFO level.
        - Guards against division by zero and invalid inputs.
        - Can be passed directly as a callback to PathRAG or other
          graph-building workflows.
